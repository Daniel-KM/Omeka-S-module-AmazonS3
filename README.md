Amazon S3 (module for Omeka S)
==============================

[Amazon S3] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows to store files via an external
storage provider, Amazon S3.

This module is compatible with [Archive Repertory], that allows to keep original
filenames for the files managed by Omeka.


Installation
------------

See general end user documentation for [installing a module].

The module uses an external library [AWS SDK], so use the release zip to
install it, or use and init the source.

* From the zip

Download the last release [`AmazonS3.zip`] from the list of releases (the master
does not contain the dependency), and uncompress it in the `modules` directory.

* From the source and for development:

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `AmazonS3`, and go to the root of the module, and run:

```
    composer install
```

The next times:

```
    composer update
```


Quick Start
-----------

Simply config your credentials in the config page of the module.

If module is active, it will replace default Local store class with S3 Storage.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on the [module issues] page on GitHub.
